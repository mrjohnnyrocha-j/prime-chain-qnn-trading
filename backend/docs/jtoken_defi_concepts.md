# JToken DeFi Concepts

## Liquidity Pools
Users can add liquidity to the JToken ecosystem using smart contracts. Liquidity is used for decentralized exchanges and other DeFi functions.

## Staking
Staking allows users to lock their JTokens for a set period and earn rewards based on the staking duration and the number of staked tokens.

## Stablecoin Pegging
A mechanism that ensures that the value of stablecoins is pegged to a target price using price oracles and supply adjustments.
